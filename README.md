> Cypress Vs Playwright Basics Workshop

## Introduction

This workshop teaches you how to write Cypress and Playwright tests using the same hands-on exercises.

## Requirements

- Any computer: Mac, Windows, Linux
- [Node 20+ (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/), see my [Node install video](https://youtu.be/09KbTRLrgWA), and my [Node versions using NVM video](https://youtu.be/CNnCz6StbbY)
- [git](https://git-scm.com)

Check the Node version

```
$ node -v
# for example v20.11.0
$ npm -v
# for example 10.2.4
```

### Example application

We will practice using the TodoMVC application I have prepared in the [bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc) repo.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc.git
cd cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc
```

In every lesson we will use _a branch_ in the "cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc" repo with the starting code.
