## Example application

We will use [bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc)

- each exercise starts in the prepared branch
- `git checkout a1` for example
- `npm install`

---

## How efficient learning works

1. I explain and show
2. We do together
3. You do and I help

**Tip:** this repository has everything to work through the test exercises.

üéì This workshop covers a subset of lessons from my course [Cypress vs Playwright](https://cypress.tips/courses/cypress-vs-playwright)

The repo has the starting code in multiple branches.

---

## Requirements

You will need:

- `git` to clone the example repo
- Node v20+ to install dependencies

```text
git clone git@github.com:bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc.git
cd cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc
git checkout <branch name>
npm install
```

---

## The app `todomvc`

Let us look at the application.

- `cd cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc`
- `git checkout main`
- `npm start`
- `open localhost:3000`

+++

It is a regular TodoMVC application.

+++

If you have Vue DevTools plugin

![With Vue DevTools](./img/vue-devtools.png)

+++

Look at XHR when using the app

![Network](./img/network.png)

+++

Look at `todomvc/index.html` - main app DOM structure

![DOM](./img/DOM.png)

+++

Look at `todomvc/app.js`

## Questions

- what happens when you add a new Todo item? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- how does it get to the server? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- where does the server save it? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- what happens on start up? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
The students should open DevTools and look at XHR requests that go between the web application and the server. Also the students should find `todomvc/data.json` file with saved items.
